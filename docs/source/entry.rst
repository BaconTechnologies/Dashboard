The *EntryScreen* component
###########################

The source code for this component is located at
`app/components/EntryScreen.jsx`


The *EntryScreen* component is also quite simple in it's implementation,
it's overarching purpose is to serve as an indicator to incoming motorists
about the zone they should seek to park in.

The component mantains in it's state the parking zone suggested by the
system, and updates it's display message whenever it changes.
