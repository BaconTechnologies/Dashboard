The *ParkingLotDashboard* component
###################################

The source file for this component is located at
`app/components/ParkingLotDashboard.jsx`.

The most complex component in the application, the *ParkingLotDashboard* is
a tabbed component, which means that only one of its two tabs is visible
at any pont in time.

The first tab of the component is called the "Overview" tab, and it displays
pie charts, for each of the parking zones, that display the status of their
occupancy and availability.

The second tab of the component, known as the "Details" tab, displays
two tables, one containing information about the parking zones and another
with the information of the places. In addition, buttons are present either
at the top of the tables or at each of the rows that allows for the creation,
modification or deletion of both zones and places.
